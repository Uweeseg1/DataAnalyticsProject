# DataAnalyticsProject
Data Analytics Project on the data of peer-lending projects in the US, 2018-2019
This Project is a 5 part Analytics project aimed at using P2P lending data to build the ideal investment portfolio.

Provided with raw data of peer to peer lending information from Softbank, 
we developed a two-layer model that improved returns compared to market alternatives by a factor of 30%.
